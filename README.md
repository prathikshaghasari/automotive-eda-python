# ðŸš— Automotive Data Analysis Project

A Python-based data analysis project focused on cleaning, transforming, and exploring automotive data. This project is designed to prepare a vehicle dataset for meaningful insights and potential use in machine learning applications.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

This project includes:

- Loading and inspecting raw automotive data
- Cleaning missing values
- Performing data type conversions
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Saving the cleaned dataset for future use

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes of vehicles such as:
- Make and Model
- Engine specifications (HP, Cylinders, Fuel Type)
- Market category
- Number of doors
- Year of manufacture

---

## ðŸ”§ Data Cleaning Steps

- Identified and handled missing values using appropriate strategies (mean, median, mode, placeholders).
- Converted data types to ensure consistency and enable proper analysis (e.g., converting `Engine HP` to float).
- Removed duplicates (if any) and standardized categorical values.
