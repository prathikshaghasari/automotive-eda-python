## ðŸ§­ How to Run This Project in Google Colab

### Step 1: Open Google Colab
- Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

---

### Step 2: Clone the GitHub Repository

In a new Colab notebook, run:

```python
!git clone https://github.com/prathikshaghasari/automotive-eda-python.git
```
---

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

```python
%cd automotive-data-analysis
```

---

### Step 4: Open the Notebook

- Click **File > Open notebook** in the Colab menu.
- Choose the **GitHub** tab and paste your repository URL.
- Select the notebook file (e.g., `automotive_analysis.ipynb`).

---

### Step 5: Load or Upload the Dataset

If the dataset isn't included:
- Use the **left sidebar in Colab** to upload `car_dataset_analysis.csv`
- Or mount your Google Drive with:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

---

### Step 6: Run the Analysis

- Execute the notebook cells in order.
- Install any missing libraries if needed:

```python
!pip install seaborn
```

---


## ðŸ”§ Data Cleaning Steps

- Identified and handled missing values using appropriate strategies (mean, median, mode, placeholders).
- Converted data types to ensure consistency and enable proper analysis (e.g., converting `Engine HP` to float).
- Removed duplicates (if any) and standardized categorical values.
- Created visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to illustrate relationships between key variables, including drivetrain type, vehicle size, and transmission type.
- Generated summary statistics to quantify trends in vehicle pricing, performance, and efficiency across various categories, supporting data-driven insights.

## ðŸ’¡ Outcome

The project successfully transformed raw automotive data into a structured, insight-rich dataset through robust cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis. By uncovering key relationships between price, performance, fuel efficiency, and market trends, the project enables data-driven decision-making for both strategic product positioning and targeted marketing. The insights can directly inform business strategiesâ€”such as aligning vehicle offerings with consumer affordability preferences, optimizing feature-value trade-offs, and leveraging brand perception to boost sales. The prepared dataset is also well-suited for future machine learning applications, such as price prediction, customer segmentation, or demand forecasting.
